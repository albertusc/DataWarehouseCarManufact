This research focuses on the implementation of a data warehouse for an automobile manufacturing company, with the aim of improving operational efficiency, customer service, and strategic decision-making. This implementation utilizes applications such as Pentaho for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which facilitates data extraction from various sources, data transformation with the addition of important information, and data upload into the database. XAMPP is used to build and manage MySQL databases in a local environment, enabling fast and structured data storage and access. Meanwhile, Apache Tomcat serves as a server to host the connected data warehouse application, supporting stable and integrated web-based access. The use of data dimensions such as employee, location, production line, product, and supplier is designed to provide more integrated and relevant information. With these applications, companies can process and analyze production data, business performance, and customer preferences in depth to identify new business opportunities, reduce costs, and develop more robust business strategies that are responsive to market needs.
